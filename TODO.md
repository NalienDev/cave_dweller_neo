# Need to fix
- If the Cave Dweller would need to crawl but it's facing the player through a corner (which contains no solid block) it won't crawl
- Sometimes gets stuck in walls for a bit
- Animations
- Reduce the amount of blockstate gets

# TODO
- Jumpscare running towards the player then disappears.
- Chance to flee when its on fire.
