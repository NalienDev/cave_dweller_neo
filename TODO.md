# Need to fix
- If the Cave Dweller would need to crawl but it's facing the player through a corner (which contains no solid block) it won't crawl
- Sometimes gets stuck in walls for a bit
- Animations
- Reduce the amount of blockstate gets
- Doesn't instantly start running when set on fire
- No crouch_run animation
- New hitbox size may lead to pathfinding problems with tunnels?

# TODO
- Jumpscare running towards the player then disappears.
